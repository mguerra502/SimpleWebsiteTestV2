This Document tells you what I have done when making my website.

The Considerations for visually impaired people were read from:

http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/design-website-for-blind/

This web page was visited the 12th of March 2017.

In the web site were embeded a couple o videos and a map of where the restaurant is located.

The search box only appears on the page and you can only access to the success.html page only through the index page. The link is in the footer and is called "Our Stars".

After finishig with your order you are redirected to the "Order COmplete" page from which you can access to the order pages to keep browsing.

Last but no the least, I did host the website on https://www.000webhost.com and the link to the website is:

https://fatherjohns.000webhostapp.com/
